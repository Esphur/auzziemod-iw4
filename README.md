auzziemod IW4 / Monaco / Zen Lite
==========

A fork SimonLfcs auzziemod and Monaco menu rework, Zen light is a lightweight version of the ZenPack azza mod.

All credit to Simon for the amazing UI and all the work put into both of these so that an absolute shit bag like
myself could come along and surgically remove their insides and somehow put togehter something that still works.

Simple mod, updated UI in both lobby and in game.

UFO, load, save, alt swap, drop weapon and that's pretty much it.

Thanks again to Simon and J33Bus.
